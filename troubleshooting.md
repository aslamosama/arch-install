# If you are unable to boot:

## Can't even get to GRUB

1. SUPERGRUB - will detect boot entries and allow you to boot manually or, boot to the Arch ISO, mount partitions, and `arch-chroot /mnt`
2. If you can't find the issue, reinstall GRUB, and ensure your configuration is updated.

```sh
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot \
--bootloader-id=GRUB
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

3. All else fails? You can try a different bootloader, ex. Refind. There are some situations where an alternate program may be the most effective solution.

## GRUB shows up, butâ€¦

### Kernel or initramfs is missing?

1. Try regenerating the initramfs: `mkinitcpio -P`
   mkinitcpio is a Bash script to create an initial ramdisk environment. It is run automatically on every kernel update with a pacman hook.
2. Reinstall: `pacman -S linux linux-firmware` or the kernel you are using

### Interrupted mid-upgrade?

- DO NOT REBOOT!!
- Check `/var/log/pacman.log` and replicate the upgrade exactly.
- If a reboot was unavoidable and your system no longer boots, head in with the Arch ISO, mount partitions, chroot, and replicate the upgrade exactly.

### Filesystem not found, or drive is read-only?

1. Boot into the Arch ISO, mount partitions, and `arch-chroot /mnt`.
2. Check your fstab! `/etc/fstab`
3. `genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab` will generate with UUIDs
4. For read/write issues, `rw,relatime` are set on that partition

### Grub doesn't show windows entry

- Mount the windows efi
- Install `os-prober`
- uncomment os-prober line in `/etc/default/grub`
- `sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`
- If entry shows up unmount the windows efi

### Filesystem corrupted due to power failure, etc?

Use fsck to check and repair.

- `fsck -a` will automatically repair.
- If `fsck` cannot find an external journal, umount, write a new journal with `tune2fs -j /dev/partition`, and then run `fsck -p /dev/partition`

### pls help nothing werks!!!

If your partitions are separated, you can easily reinstall your system on your root partition, without touching home. If they aren't separated, you can still reinstall, but ensure you've backed up all files.

> !!! ALWAYS ensure you have backed up any important data before clearing or changing partitions !!!

To save a copy of your currently installed package list:

1. `yay -Qq > packages_list`
2. Reinstall (re-pacstrap, etc) from the installation guide
3. Reinstall `yay`
4. `yay -S $(cat packages_list)`

This is also helpful if you want to set up a new system with the same packages as your current.

# Pacman and package issues:

## Recent news: update your `/etc/pacman.conf`

Remove all references to \[community\], \[community-testing\], \[testing\], \[testing-debug\], \[staging\], and \[staging-debug\] in your
`/etc/pacman.conf` as these old repositories were recently fully removed.

## Running out of space on root partition?

- Clear your package cache: `sudo pacman -Sc` or `-Scc`
- You can also set up pacman hooks to do this automatically.

## Haven't updated in a while and getting signature errors?

Update the keyring first: `pacman -Sy --needed archlinux-keyring && pacman -Su`

## Mirror-related errors?

- Re-sync your mirrors with reflector

```sh
reflector --latest 10 --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```

- If you can't use pacman to get reflector due to mirrors not working, download the tar.gz manually, and then use `pacman - U <file path>`

## Unable to lock database error

The lock file prevents two instances of pacman from running at once, but if pacman is interrupted while changing the database, the old file remains.

```sh
rm /var/lib/pacman/db.lck
```

## Manually reinstall pacman

Install the statically compiled version `pacman-static` or, boot into the Arch ISO and reinstall.

## Remove Orphaned packages

```bash
sudo pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qtdq)
```

# Slow boot time due to tpm service timeout

```bash
systemctl mask dev-tpmrm0.device
```
